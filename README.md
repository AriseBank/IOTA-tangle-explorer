# IOTA Tangle Explorer

## Introduction

This is a complete recode of the Tangle Explorer, with the following differences on <https://github.com/utamaro/tangler>:

- Completely static, only uses a IOTA node and no extra server for rendering the pages.
- Realtime, automatic updates
- Written in VueJS (React but much simpler)

Currently being worked on by me (peterwilli) as a weekend challenge and ongoing efforts to join the IOTA community.
