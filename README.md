[Donate to developer](https://iota.codebuffet.co/#/addr/GKMSVVVOAHTZSBTYALJVNHTNBQRECLRRDVMUKCXQZUTOOIDT9DTQLJHMPCYOJZIJR9DABMPOUODEUMJWOOVHMKD9NR) | [Live demo](https://iota.codebuffet.co)

## Introduction

This is a complete recode of the Tangle Explorer, with the following differences on <https://github.com/utamaro/tangler>:

- Completely static, only uses a IOTA node and no extra server for rendering the pages.
- Realtime, automatic updates
- Written in VueJS (React but much simpler)

Currently being worked on by me (peterwilli) as a weekend challenge and ongoing efforts to join the IOTA community.

## How to run

Commands are `displayed like this!`

Assuming you have NodeJS.

- cd to tangle-explorer-web
- run `npm install`
- run `npm run dev` and a web browser will pop up with the page.
